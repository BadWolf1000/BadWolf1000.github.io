    <h1>Getting Started with Nmap: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
</div>

<div class="post-body">
    <p>Nmap (Network Mapper) is one of the most powerful and widely-used tools in the cybersecurity world. Whether you're a system administrator checking your network's security or a penetration tester on an engagement, understanding Nmap is essential.</p>

    <h2>What is Nmap?</h2>
    <p>Nmap is a free, open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It uses raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services those hosts are offering, what operating systems they're running, and dozens of other characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Basic Host Discovery</h2>
    <p>The simplest way to use Nmap is to scan a single host:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
    <p>This performs a basic scan of the most common 1000 ports on the target.</p>

    <h3>Scanning Multiple Hosts</h3>
    <p>You can scan an entire subnet:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap 192.168.1.0/24</code></pre>
    <p>Or specify a range:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap 192.168.1.1-50</code></pre>

    <h2>Common Scan Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>-sS</code> - TCP SYN scan (stealth scan)</li>
        <li><code>-sT</code> - TCP connect scan</li>
        <li><code>-sU</code> - UDP scan</li>
        <li><code>-sV</code> - Version detection</li>
        <li><code>-O</code> - OS detection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service and Version Detection</h2>
    <p>To identify what services are running and their versions:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap -sV 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
    <p>This is crucial for identifying potentially vulnerable software versions.</p>

    <h2>Aggressive Scan</h2>
    <p>For a comprehensive scan that includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap -A 192.168.1.1</code></pre>

    <blockquote>
        Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any network. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Saving Output</h2>
    <p>Save your results for later analysis:</p>
    <pre><code>nmap -oN output.txt 192.168.1.1    # Normal output
nmap -oX output.xml 192.168.1.1    # XML output
nmap -oG output.gnmap 192.168.1.1  # Grepable output</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Nmap is an incredibly versatile tool with many more features than covered here. As you become more comfortable, explore NSE scripts, timing options, and advanced evasion techniques. Check out the Linux Commands section of this site for a quick reference!</p>
